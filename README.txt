make sure you have sdl2 and all derivative packages (e.g sdl2-image) using brew
**IMPORTANT**
This code only works with arm macs due to differences in brew's installations
paths. If you are running on intel, chnage the build .dylibs and header/search paths as 
seen in the xcodesdl2setup.txt.txt file
